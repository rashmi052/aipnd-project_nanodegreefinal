# AI Programming with Python Project

Hello I am Rashmi Maurya , a AWS AI & ML Scholar'24. This repository contains my final project I completed as a part of Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program. In this, I first develop code for an image classifier built with PyTorch, then convert it into a command line application. This project really helped me learn alot in the AI field using python programming.
